<h2>
Using the Python Interpreter <br>
</h2>

<h4>
By default, the input() function in Python takes values as a string. So when we use the addition operator, +, on these values, <br.
they are concatenated or joined rather than added. You will learn more about this and how to actually convert the input <br>
into the required data type in the following topics.<br>

Beautiful is better than ugly. <br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>

<h2>
Salient Features of Python - II  <br>
</h2>

<h4>
Python extension modules implement new built-in object types and can call C libraries and system calls which Python doesn’t have direct<br> 
access to.Python can be extended to work with other languages like C,C++ and Java.<br>
A standard data connectivity API facilitates using data sources such as Oracle, MySQL, and SQLite as a backend to a Python program for storage, <br>
retrieval, and processing of data. Standard DB2 API is a common interface provider to all the databases. Examples: Oracle, MySQL, DB2, etc. <br>
GUI programming is nothing but creating buttons, text boxes, other user interactable elements and attaching function to the events like button <br>
click, key press. The standard distribution of Python contains a Tkinter GUI kit, which is an implementation of the popular GUI library called Tcl/Tk.<br>
An attractive GUI can be constructed using Tkinter. Many other GUI libraries like Qt, GTK, WxWidgets, etc. are also ported to Python. <br>
Python can be integrated with other popular programming technologies such as C, C++, Java, ActiveX, and CORBA.Python provides libraries to <br>
embed Python code in other languages like Django can be used to embed python code in HTML etc.<br>

<h2>
Diff between python2 and pthon 3 <br>
</h2>

<h4>
Although the development of Python started in the late 80’s, Python 1.0 was published in January 1994. <br>
Some important features like cycle-detecting garbage collector and Unicode support were added in Python 2.0 which was released in<br>
October 2000. Python 3.0 was released in December 2008. It was designed to rectify certain flaws in the earlier version.<br>
The guiding principle of Python 3 was: "reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things". <br>
Python 3.0 doesn’t provide backward compatibility. That means a Python program written using version 2.x syntax doesn’t<br> 
execute under Python 3.x interpreter. Since all the Python libraries are not fully ported to Python 3, Python Software <br>
Foundation continues to support Python 2. The foundation has recently announced it will discontinue Python 2 support by the year 2020.<br>

<br>
Some of the obvious differences between the Python 2.x variants and Python 3.x variants are displayed below.
